# kurante
    Hint: Esperanto translation from English word of "running"

Collect and gather running status of system information related to SUSE subscriptions that can be analyzed later for consumption-based usage.

## Usage

For packaged-based (RPM) for openSUSE/SUSE, see [OpenBuildService](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:bwgartner/kurante)
- this has suggested package dependencies
- provides systemd.timers for regular runs (still need to be systemctl enabled)
